Freqsequence is a word developed by Ninja. The meaning of the word is the longest subsequence of the given string, which has characters with the highest frequency.


A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


You are given a string 'S'. Find freqsequence of the given string.


Example:
'S' = "wowow"

Here, the frequency of the character 'w' is '3', and the frequency of the character 'o' is '2'.
So, the freqsequence of the given string is "www".

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= |S| <= 10^5, |S| denote the length of the string 'S'.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
aabbcc
aaabbcc
Sample Output 1:
aabbcc
aaa
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For test case 1:
Here, the frequency of the character 'a' is '2', the frequency of the character 'b' is '2', and the frequency of the character 'c' is '2'.
So, the characters with the highest frequency are 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
So, the freqsequence of the given string is "aabbcc".


For test case 2:
Here, the frequency of the character 'a' is '3', the frequency of the character 'b' is '2', and the frequency of the character 'c' is '2'.
So, the character with the highest frequency is 'a'.
So, the freqsequence of the given string is "aaa".
Sample Input 2:
