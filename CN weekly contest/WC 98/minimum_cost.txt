Minimum Cost To Make Equal
Problem Statement
Report An Issue
You are given two strings, ‘S’ and ‘T’ of length 'N', consisting of lowercase letters only. You are also given two positive integers, ‘A’ and ‘B’. You have to make the string ‘S’ equal to the string ‘T’ by applying the following operation:


Pick an index in the string ‘S’. Suppose the character at that index in the string ‘S’ is ‘ch1’, and the character in the string ‘T’ is ‘ch2’.

You can make the character ‘ch1’ to its next or previous character in the alphabet, which costs ‘1’. E.g., You can change ‘c’ to ‘d’ or ‘b’, which costs ‘1’.
However, if you change the character ‘z’ to ‘a’, it costs ‘A’. Similarly, changing the character ‘a’ to ‘z’ costs ‘B’.
Your task is return the minimum cost to make the string 'S' equal to string 'T' by applying the above operations.


Example:
‘N’ = 4
‘A’ = 2
‘B’ = 3
‘S’ = “abz”
‘T’ = “zcb”

For index ‘0’, you need to change the character ‘a’ to ‘z’. Here, two ways are present: change ‘a’ to ‘z’, which costs ‘3’. Or converts ‘a’ to ‘b’ to ‘c’ and so on till ‘z’, which costs ‘25’. So we pick the minimum, which is ‘3’. Similarly, the minimum cost for index ‘1’ will be ‘1’ (change ‘b’ to ‘c’). And for index ‘2’, it costs ‘A’ + 1, which is ‘3’.

Therefore, the minimum cost to change ‘S’ to ‘T’ is 3 + 1 + 3 = 7.

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For test case 1:
The characters present at the 0th index are the same, therefore, no need to change anything on index '0'. For index '1', there are two ways: either increase 'h' to 'v' which costs '14' or change 'h' to 'a' then 'a' to 'z' and then from 'z' to 'v' which costs '16'. We will take the minimum of these two which is 14. Similarly, we do for index '2' and '3'. Therefore, the total minimum cost is '31'.

For test case 2:
For index '0', there are two ways: either decrease 'u' to 'l' which costs '9' or change 'u' to 'z' then 'z' to 'a' and then from 'a' to 'l' which costs '19'. We will take the minimum of these two which is 9. Similarly, we do for index '1' and '2'. Therefore, the total minimum cost is '12'.
